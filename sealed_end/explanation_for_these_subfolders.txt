Explanation of these folders:

./bAPdecay/ ./matlab/ ./pas_dend/ ./pinch_moves/ ./spines_move/ 

The pinch_moves is the default model with the method of the lengthening the dendrite from the distal spine
to the original length of 600 um.  All the other folders keep the dendrite a fixed length and
move the 3 spines along the dendrite.

The spines_move folder is done with the default spine model, and the bAPdecay and pas_dend hold
the results with models that contain half the na k (bAPdecay) and with zero na k channels in the
dendrite (pas_dend).

In each folder the model is run twice with
